## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- (Optional) `venv` or `virtualenv` for creating a clean environment

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aftab-1405/DSA.git
   cd DSA
   ```

2. **Install any dependencies** (if applicable)

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📖 Usage

Each module/directory contains:

- A **README.md** explaining the theory and approach.
- One or more Python scripts with example implementations.

To run a script:

```bash
python ARRAYS/two_sum.py
```

Or navigate into a folder:

```bash
cd ARRAYS
python two_sum.py
```

## 🗂️ Module Overview

- **linked_lists**: Singly & doubly linked list operations
- **stacks_queues**: Stack & queue implementations and problems
- **trees_graphs**: Tree traversals, graph searches (BFS, DFS)
- **sorting_searching**: Classic sorting algorithms & binary search
- **dynamic_programming**: Memoization & bottom-up DP problems
